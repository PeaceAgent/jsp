//react.js basics
//state management & reactivity


//React is a javascript library for building User Interfaces(UIs)
//Browser side javascript library

//react doesnt not runs on servers nor interacts with databases

//react goes with declarative approach: you define the result, not the steps that lead to the result

//imperative approach("normal JS"): You define all the steps to achieve the result (vanilla) and not efficient

// You define components and build your UI with these components.

//Components are UI building blocks
